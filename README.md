Aim of the data scientists can predict if delay can happen or not using the flight data and aviation weather data for a specific flight.


Air travel is increasing now a days also complex problem associated with that is also increasing now a days due tomany attributes. Consequence of flight delay impact on variables such as impacts carrier, Airport and passenger and may result in significant commercial loss or reputation loss to all the stakeholders and thus huge cost on the economy. Thus, problem on flight delay prediction plays a vital role from customer and management and time management perspective and carrier for retention of customer faith but also from Airport point of view for managing the traffic more efficiently to optimise the number of arriving flights by appropriate adjustment of schedules. One of the aspects for the flight delay is the contribution of weather conditions.
